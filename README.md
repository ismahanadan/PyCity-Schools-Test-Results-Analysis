Analyze the district-wide standardized test results to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend.

Final report should include each of the following:

District Summary
•	Create a high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including: 
o	Total Schools
o	Total Students
o	Total Budget
o	Average Math Score
o	Average Reading Score
o	% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
o	% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
o	% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)

School Summary
•	Create an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including: 
o	School Name
o	School Type
o	Total Students
o	Total School Budget
o	Per Student Budget
o	Average Math Score
o	Average Reading Score
o	% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
o	% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
o	% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)

Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
•	Create a table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include: 
o	School Name
o	School Type
o	Total Students
o	Total School Budget
o	Per Student Budget
o	Average Math Score
o	Average Reading Score
o	% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
o	% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
o	% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)

Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
•	Create a table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include all of the same metrics as above.

Math Scores by Grade**
•	Create a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
Reading Scores by Grade

•	Create a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
Scores by School Spending

•	Create a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Use 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Include in the table each of the following: 
o	Average Math Score
o	Average Reading Score
o	% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
o	% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
o	% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)

Scores by School Size
•	Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).
